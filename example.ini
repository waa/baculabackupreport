# 20220804
# --------
# This is an example config file for the baculabackupreport.py script.
# The latest version of this example config file and the script may be found at:
#
#   https://github.com/waa
#
# - Settings in here override the defaults hard coded in the baculabackupreport.py script
# - See the top of the baculabackupreport.py script for a listing and an explanation of
#   all USER VARIABLES which may be overridden in this file
# - Lines that begin with hash '#' or semi-colon ';' are comments
# - Everything after one or more spaces, a hash, one or more spaces is
#   considered an in-line comment:  var = 123  # This is an in-line comment
# - Values must not be quoted (see examples below)
# - If you need a literal '%' just escape it with another one:  jobname = Test-%%
# - By default, the script looks for the [baculabackupreport] section, but this may
#   be overridden by using the `-S sectionname` command line option
# - Be aware, the precedence is: cli > env > confg file > script. This means that any
#   settings in this config file will be silently overridden by options set on the
#   command line or options set in environment variables
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DEFAULT]
# Settings in this section are defaults
# and may be overridden in other sections
# ---------------------------------------
time = 42  # Silly number of hours to report on. Overridden in all other sections. :)
server = Bacula Server  # Name of the server to be used in email Subject
email = bacula-admin@example.com  # Default email address to send reports


[baculabackupreport]
# - This section is intentionally left blank. Do with it what you will.
# - If this config file is specified on the command line with:
#   '-C /path/to/this/example.ini', but '-S sectionname' is not specified, then
#   values in this section will be used to override the default values set in the
#   script and any default values set in the [DEFAULT] section above.
# - See examples below to use different sections to produce different reports
#   with different settings to be sent to different groups of people.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# These next four sections are what I actually use to send
# daily reports from my three Bacula Community environments
# and one Bacula Enterprise environment on Oracle Linux 8
